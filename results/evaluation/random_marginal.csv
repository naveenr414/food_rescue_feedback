"Well, this was my first delivery to Cincinnati Union Bethel (CUB - Scholar House) and after a bit of an adventure, I found them and got the donation delivered.

Our app (and my own GOOGLE MAPS app) unerringly led me to 929 E. McMillan, but that address is for an art gallery. Our app's final delivery guidance note advised me to look for the destination around the side of the building, directly across from a CVS pharmacy.

Well, the day care center isn't around the corner from the art gallery, and there's no CVS pharmacy anywhere I could find, but a helpful lady at a side door of the building advised that the day care center is at the back of the building (just about directly opposite the art gallery) and she knew our contact and was able to guide me there. I was introduced to Laneisha there and she knew our contact (who had left well before I arrived) and she accepted the donation and signed off for it.
