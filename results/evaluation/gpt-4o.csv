Well, the day care center isn't around the corner from the art gallery, and there's no CVS pharmacy anywhere I could find, but a helpful lady at a side door of the building advised that the day care center is at the back of the building (just about directly opposite the art gallery) and she knew our contact and was able to guide me there.
