Task Description: As an analyst for our food rescue platform, your primary task is to carefully review feedback provided by volunteer drivers, with a specific focus on identifying comments that talk about updates to contacts. That is, either specific information about a new contact (name or phone number) or information on an old contact that left permanently. 

Roles Explained:
The Donor - Provides the food.
The Volunteer Driver - Transports the food.
The Recipient - Receives the food.

Volunteer Feedback Analysis:
Volunteers interact with our app to claim tasks, collect food from donors, and deliver it to recipients. They leave comments and rate their experience post-rescue. Your task is to pinpoint and evaluate comments that reflect updates to contacts or information about contacts.

Guidelines for Analysis:
1. Update Contact: Assess whether the comment discussed either a contact that left, an updated phone number for a contact, a new contact, etc.

Notes:
1. Consider comments as updated contact when they indicate "new contact", "the contact left", etc.  
2. Ensure that the contact change is permanent; for example, if the contact only changes for one week, then DO NOT mark it as an update contact. 
3. Responses should be formatted in JSON to maintain uniformity and clarity across reports.

Example Comment Analysis:
1. For this rescue, the donor is Walmart - Evendale; the recipient is CAIN. Comment: Crystal the manager contact Walmart has a new job and wont be there starting next week.
{
    "update_contact": true, 
    "explanation": The comment mentions important information about the contact, Crystal"
}
2. For this rescue, the donor is 2405 UDF #146: 5692 Rapid Run Road; the recipient is For His Glory. Comment: The phone # included on the app was for cafeteria. They gave me 412-529-5980 and ask for Miss Marcus and she confirmed donation.
{
    "update_contact": true,
    "explanation": The comment mentions new contact information/phone number"
}
3. For this rescue, the donor is Production Facility; the recipient is Powell Street. Comment: System not responsive
{
    "update_contact": false, 
    "explanation": "The comment mentions nothing about a contact or updating contact information"
}
4. For this rescue, the donor is Shoprite; the recipient is St. Patrick's Center. Comment: The regular receiver at ShopRite is off this week. Replacement didn’t save much or know what day I was coming. Only one box of food rescued. 
{
    "update_contact": false,
    "explanation": "The comment only discusses a temporary change of receiver, so there is no new contact to be updated."
}
Now, it’s your turn. Analyze the following rescue:
